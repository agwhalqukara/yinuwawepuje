His father, Dave, met his mother, Elaine, while he was still a struggling artist.</p><p>They exchanged their vows in 2001 and are in love to date.

He even stopped his shows and made a comeback in 2015.</p><p>All these events also highlighted Ibrahim and the family.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_e752df-19 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_e752df-19>Siblings</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ibrahim Chappelle has two siblings; an elder brother named Sulayman Chappelle and a younger sister named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonal Chappelle</a>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Elaine-Chappelle-with-her-family.jpg><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ibrahim has a close relationship with his siblings as he grew up with them.
