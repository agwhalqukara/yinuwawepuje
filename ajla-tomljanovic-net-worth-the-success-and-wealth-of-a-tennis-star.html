<time>20 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Ajla Tomljanovi is one of the most independent and gifted professional tennis players to have come to prominence in recent years, and that much is beyond dispute. Because of this, even <a href=#>Netflix</a> didn’t think twice about include her in their documentary series “Break Point” so that we could learn more about both her professional court game and her personal objectives. But for now, if you’d just like to know more about this athlete’s remarkable background, career path, and total current net worth, we have the information you need.</p><h3>How Did Ajla Tomljanović Earn Her Money?</h3><p>Ajla, who had a Bosnian mother named Emina and a Croatian father named Ratko Tomljanovi, was born in Croatia but eventually moved to Brisbane, Australia, to be nearer to a cousin’s family for better possibilities. She actually started playing tennis when she was just 6 years old and instantly fell in love with it. At the time, she had no idea that she would eventually end up in Florida at the age of 13 to pursue more advanced instruction. However, by late 2014, the then-21-year-old had moved permanently to Australia while continuing to train and play, which meant her representation also made the move.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Ajla Tomljanovic (@ajlatom)</a></p><p>We say “re-settled” since Ajla had started racing under the Croatian flag in 2007-2008, only to legally turn pro with the support of her family in 2009 at the age of 16. She really took part in a number of International Tennis Federation (ITF) competitions during this time and, with Christina McHale, won the junior girls’ doubles title at the 2009 Australian Open. As a result, she was able to play in her first Grand Slam tournament at the French Open in 2010, which enabled her to compete in every tournament after that and enter the top 50 rankings in 2014.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u2098b324924953836ad30b057873bf4e><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>AJLA Tomljanovic and Matteo Berrettini: A Tennis Love Story</span></a><p>It should therefore come as no surprise that this tumultuous year resulted in an even more spectacular 2015, particularly because Ajla, an Australian resident, won wildcard entry and then backed them up with sheer game. She actually advanced to the Rounds of every Grand Slam competition before winning her first WTA final at the Thailand Open, although she still finished the year in the 66th position. Then she had a severe shoulder injury in the beginning of 2016 that kept her out the entire season, only for her to come back in February 2017 exactly one year later, more vibrant and powerful than ever.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Ajla Tomljanovic (@ajlatom)</a></p><p>Ajla’s success was further boosted by the fact that she was able to acquire her Australian citizenship in 2018. As a result, she made it to two more WTA Tour finals, but regrettably, she tragically lost both of them. She maintained this momentum into 2019, making it to another final, but it wasn’t enough to enable her reach a career-high ranking of 39 in the early Spring. After a difficult year brought on by the covid-19 pandemic, the young player learned from it and went on to achieve greatness in 2021 and 2022 by reaching a total of three Grand Slam quarterfinals.</p><h3>What is Ajla Tomljanović’s Net Worth?</h3><p>Ajla’s consistency the previous season helped her reach a career-high ranking of World #32 on April 3, 2023, despite the fact that she is now on a break due to a persistent knee ailment. This has therefore certainly opened up a lot of possibilities for her in terms of brand partnerships and collaborations, along with Netflix’s “Before Point,” signalling the Croatian-Australian is now doing pretty well for herself.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Ajla Tomljanovic (@ajlatom)</a></p><p>Ajla’s exact earnings are unknown, however given that winning the first round of a WTA Tour event ostensibly earns a player $100,000, it appears that she has amassed approximately $4.5 to $5 million in prize money alone over the course of her career. According to what we can determine, the alleged Boca Raton, Florida resident currently has a net worth of about $6 million after taking into account all of her assets and outgoing costs in addition to her additional income from sponsorships, partnerships, and other sources.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="ajla tomljanovic ranking,matteo berrettini net worth,ajla tomljanovic net worth,ajla tomljanovic net worth 2022,jason english net worth,who is richer jay z or michael jordan,what's flightreacts net worth,jason byrne net worth,what is caresha net worth" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
