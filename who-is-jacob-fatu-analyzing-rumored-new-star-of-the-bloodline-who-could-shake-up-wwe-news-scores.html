Anyone who has seen the 12-year veteran perform usually questioned why All Elite Wrestling or WWE hadn't scooped him up yet.</p><p>Numerous high-profile names such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Rob Van Dam</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Booker T</a> have endorsed him, and his talent and athleticism have made him a standout. So, it seemed only a matter of time until he moved to a bigger stage.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Rumors</a> that Fatu had signed with WWE started to pick up during WrestleMania 40 weekend after he withdrew from his GCW appearance on April 6. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Fightful Select</a>, the 32-year-old told others that he signed on the past Wednesday.</p><p>This led other reputable news sites to pick up the story and caused fans to speculate about how he could factor into the main event of Night 2 of The Showcase of the Immortals. Speculation persisted before the Raw after WrestleMania and Backlash, but he hasn't appeared yet.</p><p>Casual viewers may wonder how he could live up to the hype, but Fatu is the real deal. If he contributes to The Bloodline saga this year, it will be a slam dunk for WWE.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/w_800,h_533,c_fill/v1715861120/zcpde5q3qis8okuak1q8.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/w_800,h_533,c_fill/v1715861120/zcpde5q3qis8okuak1q8.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Photo credit: MLW</span><p><b>His Breakout Run With MLW</b></p><p>Fatu has been a free agent since February. Although he has worked with several indie promotions like PCW, AAW, GCW and West Coast Pro, his five-year run with Major League Wrestling put him on the map.</p><p>Early on, he rose to prominence as a member, and eventual leader of, Contra Unit. As the dominant head of the villainous group, he became the longest-reigning MLW world heavyweight champion.</p><p>Coincidentally, he held the gold during Roman Reigns' and The Usos' initial ascent as The Bloodline and proudly represented the Anoa'i family elsewhere.</p><p>The second-generation wrestler defended the title against LA Park in the main event of the company's first pay-per-view, Saturday Night SuperFight. Many fans consider their no-disqualification match his best title defense and one of his finest showings to date.</p><p>On Oct. 2, 2021, the MLW national openweight champion Alex Hammerstone finally ended his 819-day reign. Their feud also sparked the end of his tenure with Contra at War Chamber, where the other members turned on him after their loss to Team MLW.</p><p>The fans' overwhelming response to Fatu during the ensuing brawl caused him to drop his heel persona and turn face.</p><p><b>Anoa'i Family Ties</b></p><p>Fatu is related to Reigns and Jimmy and Jey Uso by blood unlike Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa, who are adopted family due to their father Haku's connection to the Anoa'i and Maivia families.</p><p>The ties to his famous cousins don't stop there because he once <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> The Usos' WWE debut inspired him to turn his life around.</p><p>Their father and his uncle, better known as Rikishi, trained him. For the remainder of his time with MLW, he embraced his roots and teamed up with Juicy Finau and Lance Anoa'i as a modern iteration of the Samoan Swat Team.</p>Rasslin' History 101 <span class=acct>@WrestlingIsKing</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Samu and Fatu,The Samoan Swat Team,with manager Paul E.Dangerously back in 1989 &lt;a href="https://t.co/aoeof8nTMT">pic.twitter.com/aoeof8nTMT&lt;/a></p><p>If that sounds familiar, it's because it was also the name of the tag team Rikishi and Samu founded in the late 1980s. Paul Heyman also managed the duo during their stint with WCW.</p><p>Fatu made his last appearance with MLW at SuperFight on Feb. 3, which aired two days after Rikishi revealed he was a free agent.</p><p><b>Jacob Fatu Is Next Up</b></p><p>His lineage and wrestling background make him an ideal addition to the Bloodline saga, but his appeal is his in-ring work and natural charisma.</p><p>No one should undersell Solo Sikoa's emergence as the de facto leader of The Bloodline, but Fatu could realistically follow Reigns as the next major superstar of the dynasty because he's further along in his career.</p><p>Due to his experience, he has already filled some of the gaps Sikoa needs to fill. The Samoan Werewolf is a dynamic performer with an impressive move set and a competent talker. Even more, he can be believably menacing when he needs to be and just as funny and likable as a protagonist.</p>Dark Puroresu Flowsion <span class=acct>@PuroresuFlow</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jacob Fatu crushes Eddie Kingston with a PERFECT Moonsault off the top of the cage ☠️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/iNjNS7ygtv">pic.twitter.com/iNjNS7ygtv&lt;/a></p><p>His heavyweight frame makes him imposing, but unbelievable athleticism allows him to execute high-flying moves like a cruiserweight. His double jump moonsault is beautiful, but his pop-up Samoan Drop is just as devastating.</p><p>The 32-year-old can convincingly pull off the physicality of a brawler, but he can also hit a handspring moonsault or spaceman plancha. WWE will be lucky to have such a talented and versatile wrestler.</p><p>Given his current schedule, it's unclear how much longer Reigns will wrestle. If he wants to pass the mantle of Tribal Chief to anyone, Fatu may be the one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmZ%2FeoSMsJ%2BoZZmoequtwqiZZp6RqcJurc2ao7KymaO0br7UpqarnZRiu6bDjKyrmqpdpLNuwMeeZJukn6SxrbXNnmSwoJ9isLDBy51krKCRoLJuwc9mrrCd</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jacob-fatu-analyzing-rumored-new-star-of-the-bloodline-who-could-shake-up-wwe-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-jacob-fatu-analyzing-rumored-new-star-of-the-bloodline-who-could-shake-up-wwe-news-scores.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jacob-fatu-analyzing-rumored-new-star-of-the-bloodline-who-could-shake-up-wwe-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-jacob-fatu-analyzing-rumored-new-star-of-the-bloodline-who-could-shake-up-wwe-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jacob-fatu-analyzing-rumored-new-star-of-the-bloodline-who-could-shake-up-wwe-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jacob-fatu-analyzing-rumored-new-star-of-the-bloodline-who-could-shake-up-wwe-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jessica-chaffin-celebsgraphy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jessica-chaffin-celebsgraphy.html>Jessica Chaffin Celebsgraphy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./top-10-minor-league-baseball-caps-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html>Top 10 Minor League Baseball Caps | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./top-10-minor-league-baseball-caps-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
