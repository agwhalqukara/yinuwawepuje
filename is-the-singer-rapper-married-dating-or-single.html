Meanwhile, Josh has found his new love, Audra Mari. Fans were shocked by their breakup and are now searching the internet to see if Fergie has found a new boyfriend in 2022.</strong></p><p><strong>Stacy Ann Ferguson</strong> (b. March 27, 1975) is an American <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>singer</a></strong>, rapper, and actress. She first rose to prominence as a member of the hip hop group the Black Eyed Peas. Her debut solo album, The Dutchess, was a commercial success, with three number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100: London Bridge, Glamorous, and Big Girls Don't Cry. She does not consider herself a rapper, despite vocally incorporating rapping into some of her performances.</p><p>Fergie was a member of the children's television show Kids Incorporated as well as the girl group Wild Orchid. She continued to work with the Black Eyed Peas, releasing two more albums with them, The E.N.D. and The Beginning. Moreover, she has also appeared in a number of films, including Poseidon, Grindhouse, and Nine. In May 2010, she released her first fragrance, Outspoken, through Avon, and she has since released four more fragrances. Likewise, Fergie Footwear, her footwear line, debuted in 2009.</p><p>People are interested in Fergie for reasons other than her music. Celebrity dating rumors are common, and her fans are curious about her relationship status. After 13 years of marriage, she divorced her ex-husband <strong>Josh Duhamel,</strong> & her fans want to know: If Fergie is dating anyone in 2022. Find out who Fergie's boyfriend is.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>relationship status</a></strong> of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>JoJo Siwa</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Shailene Woodley</a></strong>.</p><h2>Who Is Fergieâ€™s Boyfriend in 2022?</h2><p>In 2022, <strong>Fergie</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@fergie</a>) does not have a boyfriend. She is currently single and not dating anyone. The singer appears to be focusing on her life while raising her child, <strong>Axl,</strong> with her ex-husband <strong>Josh Duhamel.</strong></p><p>According to her Instagram, the singer has been busy living her life while spending time <a href=# rel=noopener>with her father</a>. The singer had previously expressed her admiration for Josh. She even stated that she intended to stay in the marriage indefinitely.</p><p>The 47-year-old American pop singer is most likely single right now. But here's the catch: Fergie may not be dating anyone in public, but she may be seeing her new boyfriend in private, and no one has mentioned it. So making snap decisions is probably not a good idea without any proper information.</p><p>Meanwhile, Josh and the rapper are great friends, and they have a lot of love for each other, despite her divorce. They adore each other but are no longer a romantic couple. They still consider each other to be family. After all, they had been together for 13 years. Above all, they both want to raise their son with love.</p><p>On the other hand, Fergie has not dated anyone new since her divorce from ex-husband Josh Duhamel but based on her joyous reaction to his engagement, it does not appear that she harbors any resentment or unresolved feelings towards her ex-husband. The tabloids tried to make Fergie jealous of Josh's new romantic interests, but the exes are actually content with their decisions and current co-parenting arrangements. She will probably announce her boyfriend's name if she starts dating someone.</p><h2>Why Did Fergie and Josh Duhamel Divorce After 13 Years of Marriage?</h2><p><strong>Fergie </strong>congratulated the happy couple on their engagement after <strong>Josh Duhamel</strong> announced his <a href=# rel=noopener>engagement</a> to model <strong>Audra Mari.</strong> Duhamel expressed a desire to find someone new to settle down with and have more children with a few years ago, and it appears that he has done so.</p><p>Josh Duhamel and Audra Mari are now&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>married</a>. After getting engaged in January 2022, the couple married on September 10, 2022, in Fargo, North Dakota. Meanwhile, Duhamel and Fergie are still co-parenting their eight-year-old son <strong>Axl</strong> with success.</p><p>However, the Big Girls Don't Cry singer and Josh married in 2009 after dating for two years. But, after eight years of what appeared to be a perfect marriage, they announced their divorce in 2017. There were no tense custody battles. There was no bad blood. It was simply a mutual decision to part ways, leaving many fans puzzled as to what went wrong. In 2019, the divorce was finalized. And, despite the former couple's best efforts to keep the situation private, certain details about what caused their split have recently come to light.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>An anonymous source revealed in 2017 that Fergie and Josh were no longer as close as they once were. They grew apart completely. This has been a long time coming, and they've spent the last year trying to figure everything out. On a few occasions, it was hinted that their work schedules had caused them to grow apart. The couple had a working strategy at first. They had a two-week rule that said they couldn't spend more than two weeks apart. However, sources claim that their schedules became out of control. According to sources, the two had absolutely nothing in common.</p><p>Additionally, in 2009, just months after their wedding, reports surfaced that Josh Duhamel had slept with a strip club dancer during a boys' night out. This allegedly occurred while he was filming Life As We Know It in Atlanta. However, Fergie denied the rumors, but reportedly paid <strong>$20,000</strong> for the story and passed a polygraph test. The couple, as it turned out, did not fully recover from the incident. According to an insider, Fergie sent spies to observe Josh at a 2016 event in Beverly Hills.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>According to the spies, Josh was flirting with a lot of women. When she confronted him about it, however, he simply denied the allegations. Fergie was also said to have paid numerous unannounced visits to the set of Josh's film, Buddy Games, starring<strong> Olivia Munn.</strong> Furthermore, she was keeping a close eye on him. According to another source, Fergie decided to call it quits when Josh continued to flirt with women and pretended to be single.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGidnqqXnrJurs6ynauhlaOxbn6Pa2lo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-the-singer-rapper-married-dating-or-single.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-the-singer-rapper-married-dating-or-single.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-the-singer-rapper-married-dating-or-single.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-the-singer-rapper-married-dating-or-single.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-the-singer-rapper-married-dating-or-single.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-the-singer-rapper-married-dating-or-single.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kate-middleton-recycles-dalmatian-coat-for-art-gallery-visit-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kate-middleton-recycles-dalmatian-coat-for-art-gallery-visit-pics.html>Kate Middleton Recycles Dalmatian Coat for Art Gallery Visit: Pics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-someone-targeting-mexico-s-butterfly-conservationists.html>Is Someone Targeting Mexico's Butterfly Conservationists?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./is-someone-targeting-mexico-s-butterfly-conservationists.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
